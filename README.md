# Seattle-Airbnb-Visualization
Tableau visualizations detailing different factors of Airbnbs in the greater Seattle area.

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to utilize the vast potential of Tableau Visualizations to give insights into how successful or unsuccessful Airbnbs of different types are in the Seattle area. 

### Data Sources

**Listings**, **Reviews**, and **Calendar**: The main data source used for this project were the three sheets within the "Seattle_Airbnbs.xlsx" file. The Listings and Reviews sheet is primarily what we used in the creation of our visualizations, and the pair together have more than 10 million rows and numerous columns of information about the individual Airbnb listings, such as price, # bedrooms, square footage, and amenities. Although this data is only for Seattle and is from 2016, more recent data and data from other locations may be found here: [Airbnb Data](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).

### Tools

- Excel - Loaded Dataset; Easy Initial Viewing
- Tableau Public - Easy Set Joining; Visualizations

### Creating the Visualizations

The visualizations we created are the following:
1. A table of number of listings per number of bedrooms.
2. A line plot for revenue generated by Seattle Airbnbs over the 2016 year.
3. A price per zipcode table overlayed onto a map of Seattle and its zipcodes.
4. An average price per bedroom bar graph.

### Completed Dashboard

The full dashboard with its limited interactables can be found on [its Tableau page](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/owen.larimer/viz/SeattleAirBnBDashboard_17318966758990/Dashboard1).

### Findings
A summary of some findings from the analysis:
 1. The zipcode with the highest average Airbnb price was 98101 (King's County).
 2. Mid June and late December returned by far the most revenue for Airbnb's, in line with the beginning of Summer and the holidays.
 3. From 1 to 4 bedrooms, price on average per bedroom decreased slightly; 5 and 6 bedrooms, however, had dramatically increased prices per bedroom.
 4. 1 bedroom listings were far and away the most numerous of listings.

### Limitations

The main limitation of this project is simply the size of the dataset. What would normally be a strength in its detail and length, certain Tableau features only allow for 15 million rows to be used at once. With the Calendar sheet joined on the Listings and Reviews sheets, the row number reached well over 20 million, and thus some details were inaccessible. 

### From Here

The visualizations presented in the above dashboard only scratch the surface of the potential of this dataset in terms of imagery. There were a multitude of columns and information pertitent to those looking to list their property or rent one that was not yet utilized simply due to being too numerous. A client wishing to learn about their options for listing in the Seattle area would greatly benefit from having this initial dashboard, but might return with additional questions that could be solved by the creation of a dashboard more specific to their needs. That job would then fall onto the Data Analyst to use this dataset in new ways to accomplish the client's vision.
